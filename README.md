# Study of the structural light and its diffraction using machine learning
The repository contains files for the generation of different structured light beams (LG, HG, and BG) and their diffraction. These files are used to create the dataset that trains a neural network aimed at predicting certain parameters of the mask applied to the beams from the intensity patterns generated by the diffraction. It also contains files for the preprocessing of experimental images obtained in the laboratory. The code may contain errors, so use with caution.
